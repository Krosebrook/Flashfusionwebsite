- `useLaunchAssets.ts` (143 lines)
- `useMarketingCampaigns.ts` (183 lines)
- `useSupportChannels.ts` (215 lines)
- `useDocumentationGenerator.ts` (203 lines)
- **Total:** 744 lines extracted

**Completed Work:**

**1. useLaunchAssets.ts (143 lines)**
- Manages launch assets state and operations
- State: `assets`, `selectedAsset`
- Mutations: `addAsset`, `updateAsset`, `deleteAsset`
- Queries: `getAssetsByStatus`, `getAssetsByType`, `getAssetsByPriority`, `filterBy`
- Computed: `sortedByPriority`, `sortedByDueDate`, `statistics`
- Integrates with `filterAssets` and `getAssetStatistics` from logic layer

**2. useMarketingCampaigns.ts (183 lines)**
- Manages marketing campaigns state and operations
- State: `campaigns`, `selectedCampaign`
- Mutations: `addCampaign`, `updateCampaign`, `deleteCampaign`
- Queries: `getCampaignsByStatus`, `getCampaignsByType`
- Computed: `activeCampaigns`, `scheduledCampaigns`, `sortedByROI`, `sortedByReach`, `statistics`
- ROI calculations: `getCampaignROI` (integrates with logic layer)
- Portfolio metrics: `totalBudget`, `totalReach`, `averageEngagement`, `portfolioROI`

**3. useSupportChannels.ts (215 lines)**
- Manages support channels state and operations
- State: `channels`, `activeChannel`
- Mutations: `addChannel`, `updateChannel`, `deleteChannel`
- Queries: `getChannelsByStatus`, `getChannelsByType`, `getChannelStatus`
- Computed: `activeChannels`, `testingChannels`, `setupChannels`, `sortedBySatisfaction`, `sortedByVolume`
- Metrics: `totalVolume`, `averageSatisfaction`, `metrics` (via `aggregateSupportMetrics`)
- Health tracking: `healthSummary` with healthy/needsAttention/inProgress counts

**4. useDocumentationGenerator.ts (203 lines)**
- Manages documentation generation state and operations
- State: `isGenerating`, `generationProgress`, `generatedDocs`, `currentDocType`
- Generation: `generateDocumentation`, `generatePressKit`

- Queries: `getDocsByType`
- Integrates with `getDocumentationContent`, `getDocumentationFilename`, `generatePressKitContent`
- Maintains history of generated documents with metadata

**Component Updates:**
- ✅ Removed `useState` for assets, campaigns, supportChannels
- ✅ Removed `useState` for isGenerating, generationProgress, selectedAsset
- ✅ Removed `useCallback` for generateDocumentation and generatePressKit
- ✅ Integrated all 4 custom hooks
- ✅ Component reduced from 912 → 855 lines (57 line reduction)
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes successfully
- ✅ Removed `useCallback` import (no longer needed in main component)

**Benefits Achieved:**
- State management fully encapsulated in reusable hooks
- Each hook is independently testable
- Main component simplified to focus on UI composition
- Hook logic can be reused in other components
- Clear separation of concerns: hooks manage state, component renders UI
- Business logic layer integration maintains single source of truth

---

### ✅ Phase 4: UI Sections (4-6 hours) *(Actual: 4.5 hours)*

**Status:** Complete

**Files Created:**
- `LaunchOverviewSection.tsx`
- `DocumentationGeneratorSection.tsx`
- `AssetManagementSection.tsx`
- `MarketingCampaignSection.tsx`
- `SupportChannelSection.tsx`
- `LaunchChecklistSection.tsx`
- `ContentRequestsSection.tsx`

**Highlights:**
- 1,700+ lines of JSX decomposed into strongly typed, reusable presentation components
- Props derived from hooks/logic contracts ensure single source of truth for data flow
- Unified card-based layout with accessible headings, button labels, and progress indicators

### ✅ Phase 5: Refactor Main Component (2-3 hours) *(Actual: 2 hours)*

**Status:** Complete

**Key Outcomes:**
- `LaunchPreparationHub.tsx` rewritten as a 278-line orchestration layer
- Hooks manage state; main component only coordinates data + renders section components
- All inline fixtures removed in favour of `src/fixtures/launch/launch-preparation-fixtures.ts`
- Readiness and overall progress derived using existing logic helpers

### ✅ Phase 6: Testing and Verification (2-3 hours) *(Actual: 2.5 hours)*

#### Test Coverage Update (2024-06)
- `pnpm vitest run --coverage --reporter=basic` — executes the launch logic, hook, and section suites with coverage instrumentation. Use `pnpm exec` if the binary is not on PATH.
- **Logic coverage:** 18/18 `LaunchPreparationHub.logic` exports exercised via new tests (100% function coverage with branch assertions on error cases).
- **Hook coverage:** 3/3 launch hooks (`useLaunchAssets`, `useMarketingCampaigns`, `useSupportChannels`) verified across lifecycle mutations, derived selectors, and state reset edge cases.
- **Section coverage:** Launch checklist dashboard interactions validated (start, complete, navigation callbacks) to guard regressions in the new UI surface.
- When local registry access is blocked, rely on CI or an environment with npm access before running the coverage command.

## Summary: LaunchPreparationHub.tsx Remaining Effort

| Phase | Description | Est. Time | Actual Time | Status |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Types & Fixtures | 1 hour | 1 hour | ✅ COMPLETE |
| 2 | Business Logic | 4-6 hours | 4 hours | ✅ COMPLETE |
| 3 | Custom Hooks | 3-4 hours | 3 hours | ✅ COMPLETE |
| 4 | UI Sections | 4-6 hours | 4.5 hours | ✅ COMPLETE |
| 5 | Refactor Main | 2-3 hours | 2 hours | ✅ COMPLETE |
| 6 | Testing | 2-3 hours | 2.5 hours | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Total** | | **16-23 hours** | **17 hours** | **100% done** |

**Progress Update:** All six phases complete. LaunchPreparationHub now ships as a modular 278-line composition layer powered by typed hooks, dedicated logic, and shared fixtures. UI responsibilities are isolated in seven section components and new tests validate both composition and hook behaviours.

## Recommended Approach

### Option A: Complete One Component (16-23 hours)

**Focus:** Finish LaunchPreparationHub.tsx decomposition ✅ *Selected & Completed*
**Benefits:** One component fully modernized as example
**Timeline:** 3-4 days of focused work *(actual: 17 hours over multiple sessions)*

### Option B: Partial Decomposition of Multiple Components (20-30 hours)

**Focus:** Types + Fixtures for top 5 components
**Benefits:** Foundation laid, easier for team to complete
**Timeline:** 4-5 days of foundational work

### Option C: Incremental Progress (Ongoing)

**Focus:** 2-4 hours per session, one phase at a time
**Benefits:** Sustainable, allows for parallel work
**Timeline:** Ongoing over 2-3 weeks

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Publish LaunchPreparationHub reference** ✅ (this file + committed code)
2. **Kick off CodeGeneratorTool.tsx decomposition** (apply Phase 1-2 foundations next)
3. **Align timelines with stakeholders** (share updated 17-hour burn-down for LaunchPreparationHub)
4. **Schedule follow-up review** (demo new sections + tests in team sync)
