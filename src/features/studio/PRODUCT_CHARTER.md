## Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

### Primary Jobs

**When** I have a musical idea or concept,  
**I want to** quickly transform it into a complete song with arrangement, melody, and production,  
**So that** I can focus on creative direction rather than technical execution.

**When** I'm learning music theory or composition,  
**I want to** explore chord progressions and lyrical structures with AI guidance,  
**So that** I can improve my craft and create better music.

**When** I've created music I'm proud of,  
**I want to** easily publish, distribute, and monetize my work across platforms,  
**So that** I can build an audience and generate income from my creativity.

### Secondary Jobs

**When** I'm collaborating with other musicians remotely,  
**I want to** work on the same project in real-time with version control,  
**So that** we can create together seamlessly regardless of location.

**When** I need to mix and master a track,  
**I want to** use AI-assisted tools that optimize levels, EQ, and effects,  
**So that** my music sounds professional without needing expensive studio time.
