# FlashFusion Roadmap (Moved)

The canonical roadmap now lives in [`docs/ops/roadmap.md`](../docs/ops/roadmap.md) alongside the executive snapshot and operational planning materials.

This legacy file previously contained an aspirational backlog that no longer reflects the current codebase. Refer to the updated document for:
- Near-, mid-, and long-term delivery milestones
- Dependencies and gating issues (private packages, Supabase provisioning, secret management)
- Success metrics and reporting cadence

If you discover stray references to this file, update them to point at the new location to keep a single source of truth.
