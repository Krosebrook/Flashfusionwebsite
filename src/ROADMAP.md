4. Enterprise features

## Getting Started - Recommended Next Actions ðŸŽ¬

1. **If you have Supabase set up:** Test the real integration thoroughly and fix any issues
2. **If still in demo mode:** Focus on implementing actual tool functionality with mock APIs
3. **Pick one high-impact area:** Start with either real tool implementations OR code generation engine
4. **Add comprehensive error handling:** Improve user experience with proper feedback
5. **Implement one real integration:** Pick Stripe for payments OR a deployment platform

## Questions for Direction ðŸ¤”

1. **What's your primary focus?** B2B enterprise tool or B2C developer platform?
2. **Monetization strategy?** Freemium, subscription, usage-based, or marketplace?
3. **Technical priorities?** AI capabilities, collaboration features, or infrastructure?
4. **Target audience?** Individual developers, small teams, or enterprises?

## Resources Needed ðŸ“š

- **AI/ML expertise** for advanced AI features
