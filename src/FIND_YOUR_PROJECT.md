# 🔍 How to Find Your FlashFusion Project

## **Quick Answer**

Your FlashFusion site/domain was claimed **in Figma Make** (this environment), but it hasn't been deployed to a live server yet. Here's how to access everything you need.

---

## **Where Is Your Project Right Now?**

### **✅ Current Status:**

1. **✅ Code Location**: Your entire FlashFusion platform is HERE in this Figma Make project
2. **✅ Site App**: Built and ready at `/apps/site` (Next.js 15)
3. **✅ Web App**: Built and ready at `/apps/web` (Vite)
4. **❌ Live Deployment**: **NOT deployed yet** - no live website accessible via browser
5. **❌ Domain Connection**: Domain registered but not connected to code

---

## **Understanding "Site Name Claimed"**

When Figma Make says **"site name was claimed"**, it means:

- **Figma Make Internal**: The name "flashfusion" is reserved in Figma Make's system
- **Not a Real Domain**: This is NOT the same as owning `flashfusion.co` domain
- **Project Name**: It's like a workspace name, not a live website

### **What You Actually Have:**

```
✅ Figma Make Project: "FlashFusion"
✅ Code Repository: Complete codebase with 1000+ files
✅ Turborepo Monorepo: Professionally structured
✅ Two Apps: /apps/site (Next.js) + /apps/web (Vite)
✅ Backend: Supabase configured
✅ API Keys: 50+ integrations ready

❌ Live Website: Not deployed yet
❌ Public URL: No URL to visit
❌ DNS Connection: Domain not connected
```

## **How to Access Your FlashFusion Project**

### **Option 1: View in Figma Make** (Current Environment)

**You're already here!** This is your project.

1. **File Structure**: Click folder icon (left sidebar) to browse all files
2. **Edit Files**: Click any file to view/edit code
3. **Preview**: Use Figma Make's preview feature to see the site

### **Option 2: Download Your Code**

To get the complete codebase on your computer:

1. **In Figma Make**: Look for "Download" or "Export" button
2. **Download as ZIP**: Get all files
3. **Extract**: Unzip on your computer
4. **Open in VS Code**: `code flashfusion-platform`

### **Option 3: Deploy to GitHub + Vercel** (Recommended)

To make it a REAL website that anyone can visit:

#### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**

```bash
# Option A: Use Figma Make's GitHub Integration
# Look for "Publish to GitHub" button in Figma Make UI

# Option B: Manual method after downloading
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial FlashFusion platform"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flashfusion-platform.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### **Step 2: Deploy to Vercel**

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Click "Import Git Repository"
3. Select your `flashfusion-platform` repo
4. Configure:
   - **Framework**: Next.js (for site app) OR Vite (for web app)
   - **Root Directory**: 
     - For site: `apps/site`
     - For web: `apps/web`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: 
     - For site: `.next`
     - For web: `dist`
5. Add environment variables (see below)
6. Click "Deploy"

#### **Step 3: Connect Your Domain**

If you own `flashfusion.co`:

1. In Vercel → Settings → Domains
2. Add `flashfusion.co`
3. Follow Vercel's DNS instructions
4. Update your domain registrar (GoDaddy/Namecheap/etc.)

## **Which App Should You Deploy First?**

### **Recommended: Deploy the Site App** (`/apps/site`)

**Why?**
- ✅ Modern Next.js 15
- ✅ SEO-optimized
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ All pages working (Home, Features, Pricing, FAQ, Contact, Demo)
- ✅ Authentication pages ready
- ✅ Mobile responsive

**Deployment:**
```bash
# In Vercel:
Project Name: flashfusion-site
Framework: Next.js
Root Directory: apps/site
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: .next
```

### **Alternative: Deploy the Web App** (`/apps/web`)

**Why?**
- ✅ Full application with all tools
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration
- ✅ Creator commerce
- ❌ Larger bundle size
- ❌ More complex setup

**Deployment:**
```bash
# In Vercel:
Project Name: flashfusion-app
Framework: Vite
Root Directory: apps/web
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
```

## **Environment Variables Required**

When deploying to Vercel, you'll need these environment variables:

### **Essential (Site App):**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your_google_analytics_id
```

### **Full List (Web App):**

You have **50+ API keys** already configured in Figma Make. Export them:

```env
# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=

## **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "Can't find my project in Figma Make"**

**Solution:**
- Check your Figma account's "Projects" or "Workspaces"

## **FAQs**

### **Q: Where is my live website?**
**A:** You don't have a live website yet. Your code is only in Figma Make. You need to deploy it to Vercel/Netlify/etc.

**A:** Yes! Use Figma Make's preview feature, or download and run locally with `npm run dev`.

### **Q: Do I own flashfusion.co domain?**
**A:** Check your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.). The Figma Make "claim" is just a project name.

### **Q: How do I access the backend?**
**A:** Your Supabase backend is already deployed. Check `/supabase/functions/server/` for the code.

### **Q: Can I edit the site?**
**A:** Yes! Edit any file in Figma Make, or download and edit locally in VS Code.

### **Q: How much does deployment cost?**
**A:** 
- Vercel: FREE (Hobby tier) or $20/month (Pro)
- Supabase: Already deployed (FREE tier)
- Domain: $12-15/year (if you own it)
