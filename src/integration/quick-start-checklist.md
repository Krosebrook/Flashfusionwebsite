# Quick Start Checklist ✅

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Prepare Your Environment** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Run these in your FlashFusion project root:
mkdir -p integration/{replit-source,components,analysis}
touch integration/analysis/findings.md
```

### 2. **Get Your Replit Project** (10 minutes)
- [ ] Download/copy your Replit project files
- [ ] Place them in `integration/replit-source/`
- [ ] Verify you can access the files

### 3. **Quick Analysis** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Create a quick inventory:
echo "# Replit Project Analysis" > integration/analysis/findings.md
echo "## Components Found:" >> integration/analysis/findings.md
find integration/replit-source -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.jsx" >> integration/analysis/findings.md

echo -e "\n## Dependencies:" >> integration/analysis/findings.md
cat integration/replit-source/package.json | grep -A 20 '"dependencies"' >> integration/analysis/findings.md
```

### 4. **Identify Top 3 Features** (10 minutes)
Look through your Replit project and identify the 3 most valuable features that FlashFusion doesn't have:

1. **Feature 1**: ________________________
   - Location in Replit: ___________________
   - Complexity: Low/Medium/High
   - Value: Low/Medium/High

2. **Feature 2**: ________________________
   - Location in Replit: ___________________
   - Complexity: Low/Medium/High
   - Value: Low/Medium/High

3. **Feature 3**: ________________________
   - Location in Replit: ___________________
   - Complexity: Low/Medium/High
   - Value: Low/Medium/High

### 5. **Start with Easiest Integration** (30 minutes)
Pick the feature with **Low Complexity + High Value** and:

- [ ] Copy the component to `integration/components/`
- [ ] Adapt it using the template pattern
- [ ] Test it works with FlashFusion
- [ ] Add it to a test page

## What You DON'T Need to Do Right Now

❌ **Don't run complex scripts** - Manual approach works fine
❌ **Don't merge everything at once** - One feature at a time
❌ **Don't worry about Node.js environment** - Copy/paste works
❌ **Don't break existing FlashFusion** - Keep it working

## Emergency Rollback

If anything goes wrong:
```bash
# Your FlashFusion is safe - just delete the integration folder
rm -rf integration/
# Your original app is untouched!
```

## Need Help?

**Common Issues:**
1. **Can't find Replit project files** → Check if it's downloaded/accessible
2. **Component won't adapt** → Start with simpler components first
3. **Dependencies conflict** → Add new ones to package.json manually
4. **Build fails** → Check console errors, fix imports

## Ready to Start?

Run this command to begin:
```bash
# This creates your workspace and is 100% safe
mkdir -p integration/{replit-source,components,analysis} && echo "✅ Ready to merge!"
```

Then follow the Simple Merge Guide step by step!
