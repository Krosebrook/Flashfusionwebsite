// The App now uses AppCoreOptimized with enhanced error recovery
import { AppCoreOptimized } from './components/core/AppCoreOptimized';
import { EnhancedErrorRecoverySystem } from './components/core/EnhancedErrorRecoverySystem';
```

### 2. Access Performance Monitoring
In development mode, access debug tools via the browser console:

```javascript
// View current performance metrics
window.ffApp.debug.performance();

// View system health status
window.ffApp.debug.health();

// View recent errors
window.ffApp.debug.errors();

// Clear all cache and restart
window.ffApp.debug.clearCache();
```
