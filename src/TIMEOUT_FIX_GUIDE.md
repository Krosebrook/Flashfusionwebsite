# FlashFusion Timeout Error Fix Guide

## Issue Description
The application is experiencing "Message getPage (id: 3) response timed out after 30000ms" errors.

## Root Cause
The timeout errors are likely caused by:
1. Missing React dependencies
2. Complex lazy loading causing component resolution failures
3. Memory optimization features interfering with normal operation
4. Monorepo configuration issues

## Solution Applied

### 1. Simplified Application Structure
- Removed complex lazy loading that was causing timeout issues
- Replaced with direct component imports for reliability
- Simplified error boundaries to prevent cascading failures

### 2. Updated Dependencies
Added essential React dependencies to package.json:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "@radix-ui/react-slot": "^1.1.2",
    "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.1",
    "clsx": "^2.0.0",
    "tailwind-merge": "^2.0.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.400.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Configuration
Updated tsconfig.json to work with the current file structure instead of the monorepo setup.

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error boundaries
- Implemented fallback error displays
- Added initialization error handling in main.tsx

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using pnpm (recommended for this project)
pnpm install

# Or using yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 2: Clear Cache and Reinstall (if needed)
```bash
# Clear node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Console**: No error messages about missing dependencies
2. **Check Loading**: App should load within 3-5 seconds
3. **Check Navigation**: All page transitions should work smoothly
4. **Check Memory**: Emergency mode should only activate on very low memory devices

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting Timeouts:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Open browser DevTools > Network
   - Look for failed requests or slow loading resources

3. **Check Console Errors**:
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check for missing files or 404 errors

4. **Try Incognito Mode**:
   - Disable browser extensions
   - Test in private/incognito window

### If Dependencies Are Missing:

1. **Manual Installation**:
```bash
npm install react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom
npm install @radix-ui/react-slot class-variance-authority
npm install clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react
npm install @vitejs/plugin-react
```

2. **Check Package Manager**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct package manager (pnpm recommended)
   - Check if you have sufficient permissions

### If Build Errors Occur:

1. **Type Check**:
```bash
npm run type-check
```

2. **Clean Build**:
```bash
rm -rf dist
npm run build
```

## Current Application Features

The simplified application now includes:
- **Safe Mode Interface**: Memory-optimized version of FlashFusion
- **Emergency Recovery**: Automatic memory crisis detection and recovery
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Simple Navigation**: Reliable page transitions without lazy loading

## Next Steps

Once the timeout issues are resolved:
1. Gradually re-enable advanced features
2. Add back complex components one by one
3. Monitor for performance issues
4. Implement proper lazy loading with timeout handling

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Ensure proper Node.js version (>=18)
4. Contact support with specific error details

**Note**: This is a temporary simplified version to resolve the timeout issues. Full FlashFusion features will be gradually restored once stability is confirmed.
