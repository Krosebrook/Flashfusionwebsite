# FlashFusion Memory Optimization Checklist

## ‚úÖ Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)
- [ ] Replace PageRouter with MemoryAwarePageRouter
- [ ] Add MemoryMonitor to navigation
- [ ] Test emergency cleanup functionality
- [ ] Verify CSS memory optimizations are working

## üöÄ Short-term Actions (24 hours)
### Component Optimization
- [ ] Implement React.memo for heavy components:
  - [ ] MultiAgentOrchestrationDashboard
  - [ ] FullStackAppBuilder  
  - [ ] IntelligentAnalyticsDashboard
  - [ ] TeamDevelopmentDashboard
  - [ ] CreatorCommerceHub

### Code Splitting Improvements
- [ ] Split large components into micro-components
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for:
  - [ ] Team member lists
  - [ ] Project lists  
  - [ ] Analytics data tables
  - [ ] Tool catalogs

### Data Management
- [ ] Implement data pagination (max 50 items per page)
- [ ] Add infinite scroll instead of loading all data
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed data in memory-aware cache
- [ ] Clear old localStorage data (keep only last 30 days)

### Asset Optimization  
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for images
- [ ] Compress and optimize SVG icons
- [ ] Use WebP format for images where supported
- [ ] Remove unused CSS classes and animations

## üîß Medium-term Actions (1 week)
### Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Implement service worker for better caching
- [ ] Add memory-aware component loading strategy
- [ ] Create lightweight versions of heavy components
- [ ] Implement component pooling for frequently used elements

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set up memory usage alerts at 85% threshold
- [ ] Add performance budgets for each page
- [ ] Implement automatic cleanup triggers
- [ ] Monitor bundle size growth over time

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Implement query result caching
- [ ] Add database connection pooling
- [ ] Optimize data fetching strategies
- [ ] Implement data prefetching for critical paths

## üéØ Long-term Actions (1 month)
### Advanced Optimizations
- [ ] Implement Web Workers for heavy computations
- [ ] Add memory-aware image processing
- [ ] Create adaptive quality based on device capabilities
- [ ] Implement progressive loading for large datasets

### Infrastructure  
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement edge computing for data processing
- [ ] Add memory monitoring to production
- [ ] Create automated performance regression tests

## üìä Success Metrics
### Memory Usage Targets
- [ ] Keep memory usage below 75% during normal operation
- [ ] Emergency mode activates only above 90% usage  
- [ ] Page load time under 2 seconds for main routes
- [ ] Bundle size under 500KB per route

### Performance Targets
- [ ] First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.5s
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.0s
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- [ ] First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms

## üîç Memory Debugging Tools
```bash
# Check bundle size
npm run build -- --analyze

# Monitor memory usage in Chrome DevTools
# 1. Open DevTools > Performance tab
# 2. Enable "Memory" checkbox  
# 3. Record page interaction
# 4. Check memory timeline

# Check for memory leaks
# 1. Open DevTools > Memory tab
# 2. Take heap snapshots before/after actions
# 3. Compare snapshots for memory leaks
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs to Watch
- Memory usage consistently above 85%
- Page load times increasing over time
- Browser tab crashes or becomes unresponsive  
- Gradual performance degradation during use
- Frequent garbage collection cycles

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fixes for Critical Memory Issues
1. **Immediate**: Force page refresh
2. **Emergency**: Clear all localStorage/sessionStorage
3. **Nuclear**: Clear browser cache and cookies
4. **Last resort**: Restart browser completely

## üìù Notes
- Test memory optimizations on low-end devices
- Monitor memory usage after each deployment
- Keep performance budget in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular memory audits every sprint
- Document memory requirements for new features
