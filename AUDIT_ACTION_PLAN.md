# Repository Audit - Action Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

---

## âœ… Immediate Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed package.json Dependency Issues
**Changes Made**:
- âœ… Removed invalid Node.js built-in modules from dependencies:
  - `child_process`
  - `fs`
  - `node:fs`
  - `node:path`
  - `path`
  - `url`
- âœ… Updated Vite version from `6.3.5` to `^7.0.0` (resolves peer dependency conflict)
- âœ… Added comprehensive npm scripts for development workflow

**New Scripts Available**:
```json
{
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
  "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --fix",
  "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx,json,css,md}\"",
  "format:check": "prettier --check \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx,json,css,md}\"",
  "test": "vitest run",
  "test:watch": "vitest",
  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
}
```

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Remaining

### 1. Wildcard Dependencies (60+ packages)
**Risk**: High - Unpredictable builds, security vulnerabilities

**Affected Packages**:
- All `@flashfusion/*` packages
- All `@radix-ui/*` packages marked with `*`
- `@playwright/test`, `@prisma/client`, `@storybook/*`
- `clsx`, `date-fns`, `express`, `hono`, `jszip`, `motion`, `next`
- `tailwindcss`, `vite` (in dependencies), `vitest`, `yaml`, `zod`
- Many more...

**Recommendation**: 
1. Determine if `@flashfusion/*` packages are local monorepo packages or external
2. Pin all external packages to specific versions
3. Use `npm list <package>` to find current installed versions
4. Update to semantic versioning ranges (e.g., `^1.2.3` instead of `*`)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### 2. Missing Critical Dependencies
**Issue**: Many packages listed in dependencies may need to be installed

**Action Required**:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Note: The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag may be needed due to the many wildcard dependencies.

---

## ðŸŸ  High Priority Issues

### 3. No CI/CD Pipeline
**Current State**: `.github/workflows/` only contains planning document

**Recommendation**: Create basic CI/CD workflow

**Sample Workflow** (save as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
      - run: npm run type-check
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run build
```

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

---

### 4. Code Organization Issues

**From Existing Audits**:
- 5 components over 1,500 lines each
- `file-generators.ts`: 2,316 lines
- Fixture compliance: 57% (3 violations found)
- Schema validation issues: 8 issues identified

**Status**: Already documented with remediation plans in:
- `AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- `FIXTURE_AUDIT.md`
- `SCHEMA_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`

**Estimated Total Time**: 30-40 hours (as per existing reports)

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

### 5. Test Coverage Low (~5%)
**Target**: 35% minimum
**Current**: ~5% (20 test files exist but coverage not measured)

**Action Items**:
1. Verify test configuration works
2. Run `npm run test:coverage`
3. Add tests for critical paths
4. Set up coverage thresholds

**Estimated Time**: Ongoing, ~10-15 hours for baseline

---

### 6. Security Audit Not Run
**Blocker**: Could not run until dependencies are fixed

**Action Required**:
```bash
# After fixing dependencies:
npm audit
npm audit fix

# For automated security scanning:
# Add to CI/CD workflow
```

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes initial, ongoing monitoring

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority / Long-term

### 7. Bundle Optimization
- No production build verified
- No bundle analysis performed
- Target: <1MB gzipped (unverified)

### 8. Accessibility Testing
- No a11y tests configured
- Recommendation: Add @axe-core/react

### 9. Performance Monitoring
- No monitoring setup
- Consider: Sentry, LogRocket, or similar

### 10. Monorepo Clarification
- Mixed signals about monorepo structure
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` exists
- `@flashfusion/*` packages referenced but unclear if local/external

---

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Step 1: Verify Build Works (30 min)
```bash
# Try installing dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Verify type checking
npm run type-check

# Attempt build
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Pin Dependencies (2-3 hours)
- Research each wildcard dependency
- Determine appropriate versions
- Update package.json
- Test thoroughly

### Step 3: Set Up CI/CD (1 hour)
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Test workflow
- Add status badge to README

### Step 4: Run Security Audit (30 min)
```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

### Step 5: Address Code Issues (30-40 hours)
- Follow existing plans in AUDIT_REPORT.md
- Component decomposition
- Fixture compliance
- Schema validation

## Summary

### What Was Fixed âœ…
1. Invalid Node.js built-in modules removed from dependencies
2. Vite version conflict resolved
3. Comprehensive npm scripts added
4. Comprehensive audit report created

### What Needs Immediate Attention ðŸ”´
1. Pin wildcard dependencies (CRITICAL)
2. Verify npm install works
3. Set up basic CI/CD
4. Run security audit

### Documentation Created ðŸ“„
1. `COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_2025.md` - Full audit findings
2. `AUDIT_ACTION_PLAN.md` - This file (actionable steps)

**Audit Status**: PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Critical blockers identified and partially fixed  
**Next Auditor**: Should focus on dependency pinning and CI/CD setup  
**Estimated Time to Baseline**: 8-12 hours focused work
