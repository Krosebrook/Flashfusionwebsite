## The 5-Step Plan

### Step 1: Quality Foundation (2-4 hours)
**Goal**: Establish automated code quality gates

- Install linting packages (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
- Run auto-fixes across entire codebase
- Add quality scripts to package.json
- Set up pre-commit hooks

**Impact**: Immediate codebase-wide quality improvement

### Step 2: Code Modernization (12-16 hours)
**Goal**: Execute high-impact refactoring patterns

- Split file-generators.ts (2,316 lines â†’ 9 modules)
- Extract mock data from top 10 components
- Apply Tailwind primitives to key components

**Impact**: 61% reduction in largest file, 1,500-2,000 line reduction

### Step 3: Component Decomposition (20-30 hours)
**Goal**: Decompose top 5 critical components

Target components (1,976-1,682 lines each):
1. LaunchPreparationHub.tsx
2. CodeGeneratorTool.tsx
3. FullStackAppBuilder.tsx
4. UserPersonaCards.tsx
5. AgentDesignerTool.tsx

Reduce each to < 500 lines using 7-step decomposition pattern

**Impact**: Major maintainability improvement, easier to test

### Step 4: Testing Infrastructure (10-15 hours)
**Goal**: Establish 35% test coverage baseline

- Configure Vitest and Testing Library
- Create test utilities and templates
- Write 40-60 test files for critical paths
- Set up CI/CD testing pipeline
- Generate coverage reports

**Impact**: Automated quality assurance, confidence in changes

### Step 5: Production Readiness (8-12 hours)
**Goal**: Optimize and deploy to production

- Bundle optimization (-300KB target)
- Performance optimizations (lazy loading, memoization)
- Configure Vercel deployment
- Complete production readiness checklist
- Set up monitoring and analytics

**Impact**: Production-ready application, optimized performance

## Immediate Next Actions

### For You (Developer)

**Option A: Start Immediately**
```bash
# 1. Begin with Step 1 - Quality Foundation
pnpm add -D eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin \
  eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-import \
  eslint-import-resolver-typescript eslint-config-prettier prettier \
  husky lint-staged

# 2. Run auto-fixes
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --fix
npx prettier --write "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,json,md}"

# 3. Verify
pnpm type-check
```

**Option B: Review First**
1. Read `docs/NEXT_PHASE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (30-45 min)
2. Review `reports/NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.json` for details
3. Choose starting point based on priorities

**Option C: Customize**
1. Adjust priorities based on your needs
2. Modify timeline to fit your schedule
3. Execute steps in different order if needed

### For Team

**Parallelization Opportunities**:
- Step 1 can be done by 1 person (2-4h)
- Step 2 can be split: utilities (1 person), mocks (1 person)
- Step 3 can be split: 1 component per person (5 people)
- Step 4 can be split: tests by domain (2-3 people)
- Step 5 can be done by 1 person (8-12h)

**Optimal Team**: 2-3 developers can complete in 2-3 weeks
