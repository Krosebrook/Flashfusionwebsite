## Inconsistencies Found and Fixed

### 1. Branch Name Mismatch
**Found in:** AUDIT_REPORT.md, docs/DEVELOPER_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md
**Issue:** Referenced old branch `claude/explore-web-environment-011CUXBY4CakEXKw7KmoUzEX` and `claude/general-refactoring-011CUWcE92TD4U8argM1HhWS`
**Fixed:** Updated to current branch `claude/search-location-compare-011CUXpBz1KYSEsBbJndh7Fp`

### 2. Outdated Component Line Count
**Found in:** reports/components-decomposition.json
**Issue:** LaunchPreparationHub.tsx listed as 1,976 lines
**Fixed:** Updated to 912 lines with original line count preserved for reference

### 3. Missing Audit Report References
**Found in:** docs/DEVELOPER_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md
**Issue:** New audit reports not referenced in reading list
**Fixed:** Added "Recent Audit Reports" section with links to all new reports

### 4. Incomplete Fixture Extraction Documentation
**Found in:** reports/components-decomposition.json
**Issue:** Only 1 fixture documented, but 7 exist
**Fixed:** Expanded fixturesExtracted array to include all 7 fixtures with metadata

### 5. Missing Logic Module Documentation
**Found in:** reports/components-decomposition.json
**Issue:** Logic module extraction not documented
**Fixed:** Added logicModulesExtracted section with full details

### 6. Outdated Progress Tracking
**Found in:** docs/DEVELOPER_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md
**Issue:** Progress dashboard showed Phase 1 as "PATTERN ESTABLISHED" but Phase 2 is now complete
**Fixed:** Updated to show Phase 1 "IN PROGRESS" with Phase 2 checkmarks

---

## Files NOT Updated (and Why)

### reports/REFACTORING_SUMMARY.json
**Reason:** This file documents the general refactoring infrastructure phase, not the Step 3 decomposition work. It remains accurate for its scope and should not be modified to avoid confusion between different refactoring phases.

### reports/NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.json
**Reason:** This file contains the execution plan created earlier. The work completed (Phase 2) was documented in the decomposition-specific files instead.

### migration-notes.md
**Reason:** This file is a chronological changelog. The current work is documented in dedicated audit reports and the Step 3 decomposition plan. Migration notes would be updated when merging branches or making architectural changes.

### Other JSON reports in /reports/
**Reason:** Files like tailwind-primitives.json, duplicates-resolution.json, lint-type-hygiene.json, etc. document specific refactoring phases that remain unchanged. No updates needed.

## Recommendations

### Documentation Improvements

1. **Add Visual Progress Dashboard**
   - Consider adding a progress chart or table to README.md
   - Show overall refactoring completion percentage
   - Visualize Phase 1-6 progress for LaunchPreparationHub

2. **Create Fixture Compliance Tracker**
   - Add a dedicated tracking document for fixture extraction progress
   - List all 29 components with fixture status
   - Track compliance percentage over time

3. **Schema Health Dashboard**
   - Create ongoing schema validation tracking
   - Monitor drift over time
   - Track remediation progress

4. **Automated Documentation Sync**
   - Consider adding git pre-commit hooks to verify doc sync
   - Auto-update line counts in JSON files
   - Validate cross-references on commit

### Process Improvements

1. **Single Source of Truth for Metrics**
   - Consider creating a metrics.json file that all docs reference
   - Avoid duplicating line counts across multiple files
   - Use automated tools to extract actual line counts

2. **Documentation Review Checklist**
   - Create checklist for doc updates after parallel tasks
   - Ensure all artifacts are cross-referenced
   - Verify branch names are current

3. **Report Templates**
   - Create standardized templates for audit reports
   - Ensure consistent structure across reports
   - Include required cross-reference sections
