# Launch Preparation Hub Feature Specification

**Last Updated**: 2024-03-15
**Status**: Draft
**Audience**: Product, Engineering, Design, QA

## Overview
The Launch Preparation Hub centralizes tooling that helps FlashFusion teams orchestrate go-to-market readiness across documentation generation, marketing asset management, support operations, and legal compliance. It extends the existing launch fixtures and logic modules to provide a cohesive workflow that reduces manual effort and ensures every launch meets the production-readiness expectations outlined in the execution roadmap.

## Background & Related Work
- `docs/NEXT_PHASE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` establishes the production readiness guardrails (\<500 line components, baseline test coverage, bundle-size optimization) that the hub must respect.
- `docs/COMPONENT_DECOMPOSITION_GUIDE.md` and `docs/UTILITY_SPLIT_PLAN.md` describe the modular architecture patterns the hub should align with for maintainability and testability.
- Current UI scaffolding and business logic live in `src/components/launch/LaunchPreparationHub.tsx` and `tests/unit/components/launch/LaunchPreparationHub.logic.test.ts`, providing baseline capabilities that the feature must harden and expand.

## Stakeholder Alignment
- **Product**: Maya Chen (GTMS Lead)
- **Engineering**: Luis Ortega (Frontend), Priya Desai (QA)
- **Design**: Nina Patel (Product Design)
- **Marketing Ops**: Evan Ross

**Stakeholder Sync**: Scheduled for 2024-03-18 @ 10:00 AM PT. Agenda will confirm success metrics, UX validation paths, and edge-case coverage responsibilities.

## Goals & Success Metrics
1. **Reduce launch preparation time** by 40% vs. current manual checklist baseline measured across the last three launches.
2. **Documentation coverage**: 100% of launch templates (user manual, API docs, tutorials, FAQ, press kit) generated with no validation errors in the QA environment.
3. **Operational readiness**: Launch readiness score consistently â‰¥85% before go-live, calculated via `calculateLaunchReadiness`.
4. **Quality gates**: Maintain <500 line component size, 85%+ unit test coverage for hub logic, zero new ESLint violations, and no regression in bundle size as verified by `pnpm quality` pipeline after integration.

## Out of Scope
- Building new AI content-generation models (reuse existing `useDocumentationGenerator` APIs).
- Net-new marketing analytics dashboards (limit to ROI metrics already exposed via `useMarketingCampaigns`).
- Support ticket escalation workflows outside of the hub context.
- Payment or subscription gating around launch features.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Documentation Automation**
   - Trigger generation for each supported asset type with progress telemetry and error recovery.
   - Allow download in PDF and Markdown formats via `multi-format-download` utilities.
   - Surface validation feedback when `validateDocumentationRequest` rejects a type.
2. **Marketing Campaign Command Center**
   - Display ROI, reach, engagement, and budget insights in a single view.
   - Provide quick actions to duplicate or pause campaigns, integrating with `useMarketingCampaigns` state handlers.
3. **Support Operations Panel**
   - Visualize status per support channel (chat, email, community) and alert when SLAs fall below thresholds.
   - Offer templated responses using existing marketing copy processors for consistency.
4. **Legal & Compliance Tracker**
   - Map each legal checklist item to responsible owner and due date with reminders.
   - Store signed artifacts metadata securely (no storage of files in-app, only metadata references).
5. **Launch Checklist Orchestration**
   - Aggregate readiness metrics, highlight blockers, and allow export of the checklist snapshot.
   - Provide audit trail entries when readiness moves between key thresholds (60%, 80%, 90%).

## UX & Interaction Flows
1. **Launch Manager Workflow**
   - Access hub from navigation > Launch > Launch Preparation Hub.
   - Review readiness summary banner.
   - Drill into each tab (Docs, Marketing, Support, Legal, Checklist) to complete outstanding tasks.
   - Generate documentation assets and download deliverables.
   - Share export with stakeholders and trigger final sign-off.
2. **Marketing Ops Workflow**
   - Monitor campaign ROI, adjust budgets, duplicate high-performing campaigns.
   - Request updated copy templates and push to social scheduler.
3. **Support Lead Workflow**
   - Track SLA compliance, escalate via existing messaging channels, and log resolution updates.
4. **Compliance Workflow**
   - Confirm legal documents, assign ownership, and register completion evidence.

### UX Considerations
- Maintain existing design system tokens from `src/components/ui` and adhere to typography/color variables defined in `src/constants/core.ts`.
- Provide responsive layouts with tab-based navigation, ensuring accessibility via keyboard and screen-reader support.
- Include inline alerts for validation feedback with clear remediation steps.

## Corner Cases & Error Handling
- Network failure during document generation should retry up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff and expose a manual retry button.
- Incomplete fixture data (missing campaigns, assets) should fall back to empty states with guidance.
- ROI calculations must guard against division by zero when budgets are zero; display "N/A" with tooltip.
- Legal artifact metadata missing due dates should flag as blocking issues to maintain readiness scores.

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Must integrate with modular generator utilities per `docs/UTILITY_SPLIT_PLAN.md` to avoid monolithic files.
- Ensure new hooks/components remain below 300 lines each to align with decomposition guidelines.
- Observability: emit structured logs via existing analytics service without leaking PII, and ensure telemetry toggles follow privacy settings.

## Analytics & Telemetry
- Track events for document generation, campaign status changes, support SLA breaches, legal completion confirmations, and readiness exports via `FlashFusionAnalytics`.
- Capture latency metrics for generation workflows to monitor p95 under 2 seconds for metadata fetches.
- Record readiness score transitions for trend analysis.

## Accessibility & Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with focus states, ARIA labels on tabs/cards, and high-contrast color schemes.
- Provide textual alternatives for icon-only actions and ensure keyboard navigation coverage.

## Testing Strategy
- Expand unit tests in `tests/unit/components/launch/LaunchPreparationHub.logic.test.ts` for new calculations and error paths.
- Add integration tests covering documentation generation flows and ROI updates.
- Create E2E scenario in Playwright to validate multi-tab completion and export functionality.

## Open Questions
1. Should we integrate with external ticketing systems for support escalation in this release?
2. Do we need localization for generated assets before GA?
3. What is the retention policy for stored launch readiness audit logs?

## Approval & Sign-Off Plan
1. Circulate this spec to stakeholders via Confluence + Slack (#launch-readiness) on 2024-03-15.
2. Collect asynchronous feedback before the 2024-03-18 sync.
3. Update the spec based on meeting outcomes and request final approval from Product & Engineering leads prior to implementation kickoff.
