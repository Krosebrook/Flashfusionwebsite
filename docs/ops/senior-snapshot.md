# FlashFusion Senior Snapshot

**Last Updated**: 2024-11-24  
**Status**: Published  
**Audience**: Executives, Engineering Leads, Product, Ops

---

## 1. Product Overview
- **Experience**: Single-page React application delivering a marketing landing surface, gated app shell, and interactive demo (`src/App.tsx`, `src/components/core/AppCoreOptimized.tsx`).
- **Modes**: Authenticated mode powered by Supabase Auth when credentials exist; "demo" mode falls back to local storage for exploration (`src/components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx`, `src/utils/auth-protection.ts`).
- **Brand System**: Centralized design tokens and animations defined in `src/styles/globals.css` ensure consistent FlashFusion theming across components.

## 2. Architecture at a Glance
- **Frontend Stack**: React 18 rendered via Vite with StrictMode and resilient bootstrapping (`src/main.tsx`).
- **State & Providers**: Authentication context plus domain-specific hooks/services (e.g., `src/hooks/useGamification.ts`, `src/services/GamificationService.ts`).
- **Backend Adapters**: Supabase edge functions implemented with Hono under `src/supabase/functions/server/`, but shipping in mock/demo configuration until env keys are supplied (`src/lib/supabase.ts`).
- **Deployment Scripts**: Shell utilities (`deploy-production.sh`, `deploy-site.sh`, `deploy-web.sh`) mirror historic pipelines for Vercel/Netlify style targets.

## 3. Feature Surface & Coverage
| Surface | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Marketing Landing + Navigation | ✅ Functional | Rich hero, pricing, testimonials, global navigation via `src/components/landing/` & `src/components/layout/` modules.
| Auth & User Shell | ⚠️ Demo-only | AuthProvider orchestrates flows; real Supabase auth blocked without secrets, demo session uses local storage.
| Project/Dashboard Modules | ⚠️ Prototype | Views exist with placeholder data; reliant on mocked services.
| Gamification & XP | ⚠️ Prototype | GamificationService expects Supabase tables but populates demo data when API unavailable.
| Automation/AI Tools | ⚠️ Planned | AIService catalog present; actual provider calls gated behind missing API keys.

## 4. Data, Integrations & Security
- **Supabase**: `src/lib/supabase.ts` auto-detects absence of credentials and swaps to a mock client; no persistent data without configuration.
- **Third-party APIs**: AI providers enumerated in `src/services/AIService.ts`, API key lifecycle managed via `src/services/APIKeyService.ts` (requires secret storage not yet provisioned).
- **AuthZ**: Route protection and permission helpers live in `src/utils/auth-protection.ts`; RBAC beyond demo mode remains unimplemented.
- **Secrets Management**: `.env.local` (from `src/_env_example.tsx`) must be supplied manually; ensure values are stored in the deployment platform's secret manager.

## 5. Quality, Testing & Observability
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest suites under `tests/unit/` target key hooks/services (e.g., gamification, AI service). Execution currently blocked by missing proprietary packages.
- **E2E**: Playwright harness defined in `tests/e2e/`; smoke coverage expected once dependency/install path stabilizes.
- **Runtime Safety**: ErrorBoundary and Suspense fallbacks provide branded failure states for interface, auth, and demo routes (`src/components/core/AppCoreOptimized.tsx`).
- **Telemetry**: Console logging and toast notifications exist; structured logging/tracing for backend functions stubbed via Hono middleware (`src/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`).

## 6. Operational Readiness
- **Build**: `pnpm run build` produces static assets; ensure CI runner can access internal packages before adding build gates.
- **Deployments**: Legacy shell scripts should be treated as references; validate environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) prior to pushing live.
- **Monitoring Hooks**: Supabase edge functions expose health endpoints (`/make-server-88829a40/health`); integrate with uptime monitoring once deployed.

## 7. Risks & Gaps
1. **Private Dependencies** – `@flashfusion/*` packages referenced in `package.json` are unavailable publicly, blocking install/test pipelines until registry access or stubs exist.
2. **Demo-Mode Persistence** – Without Supabase credentials, data is non-persistent; roadmap must include production database provisioning and migration scripts.
3. **Security Review Pending** – Auth flows lack hardened RBAC and rate limiting when running beyond demo mode; audit required before go-live.
4. **Testing Coverage** – Automated tests exist but cannot execute end-to-end; CI/CD cannot be enforced yet.

## 8. Next Steps (0/30/60/90)
- **Day 0**: Restore dependency installs (internal registry or package mirrors). Document credentials and `.npmrc` setup.
- **30 Days**: Configure Supabase project, migrate gamification tables, and enable real auth + data flows. Update API key management strategy.
- **60 Days**: Harden edge functions (authz, rate limiting), enable analytics/observability, and stabilize CI (Vitest + Playwright) in staging.
- **90 Days**: Ship production-ready launch with Stripe/billing integration, AI provider entitlements, and post-launch monitoring dashboards.
