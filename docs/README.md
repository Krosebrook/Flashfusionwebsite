Historical, high-volume documentation from earlier phases still lives in `src/` (for example `src/COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`). Treat those files as archival references until they are triaged into the structure above.

## Quick Links
- **Executive Snapshot**: [`docs/ops/senior-snapshot.md`](./ops/senior-snapshot.md)
- **Roadmap**: [`docs/ops/roadmap.md`](./ops/roadmap.md)
- **Operational Runbooks**: [`docs/ops/new-feature-rollout.md`](./ops/new-feature-rollout.md)
- **API Specifications**: [`docs/api/`](./api/)
- **Testing References**: [`docs/testing/`](./testing/)
- **UI Standards**: [`docs/ui/`](./ui/)

## Documentation Standards
Every new or updated document should follow this header block:
```markdown
# Title

**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: Draft | Review | Published
**Audience**: Developers | Product | Ops | All
```

### Writing Guidelines
- Keep titles action-oriented (e.g., "Deploying Supabase Functions")
- Call out prerequisites, security considerations, and rollback steps
- Cross-link related documents to avoid duplication
- Record TODOs with owners and target dates when applicable

### Change Management
1. Update or create the relevant document under `docs/`
2. Add the file (or section) to this index when it becomes canonical
3. Reference the document from PR descriptions when functionality ships
4. Archive superseded documents in `archive/` with a deprecation notice

## Migration Backlog
- ‚úÖ Executive snapshot + roadmap refreshed (November 2024)
- üîÑ Migrate critical guides from `src/` into `docs/` (in progress)
- ‚è≥ Audit testing documentation for parity with current tooling (Vitest + Playwright)
- ‚è≥ Consolidate Supabase setup instructions into a single deployment guide

Please log additional documentation gaps in the engineering backlog and link them here once scheduled.
