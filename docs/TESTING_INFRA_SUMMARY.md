## Test Execution Results

### Initial Test Run (2025-10-27 14:24:08)

**âœ… Successful Tests:**
- `tests/unit/components/launch/LaunchPreparationHub.logic.test.ts`: **40 tests passed**

**Note:** All newly created tests for LaunchPreparationHub passed successfully.

---

## Current Coverage

### Baseline Coverage: ~5%
- Minimal existing tests
- Limited component coverage
- No systematic test coverage

### Target Coverage: 35%
**Path to 35% Coverage:**
1. âœ… LaunchPreparationHub business logic (40 tests)
2. âœ… LaunchPreparationHub component smoke tests
3. âœ… E2E smoke tests for critical paths
4. ðŸ”„ Additional component tests (next phase)
5. ðŸ”„ Integration tests (next phase)
6. ðŸ”„ Custom hooks tests (next phase)

**Coverage Report Location:**
- HTML: `./coverage/index.html`
- JSON: `./coverage/coverage-final.json`
- Text: Console output

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Priority 1)
1. **Install Playwright browsers** in proper environment:
   ```bash
   pnpm exec playwright install
   ```

2. **Run component tests** to verify UI:
   ```bash
   pnpm test tests/unit/components/launch/LaunchPreparationHub.test.tsx
   ```

3. **Generate initial coverage report:**
   ```bash
   pnpm test:coverage
   ```

### Short-term (Priority 2)
4. **Write tests for custom hooks:**
   - `useLaunchAssets.ts`
   - `useLaunchPreparation.ts`
   - Other extracted hooks

5. **Add integration tests:**
   - User workflows through LaunchPreparationHub
   - Documentation generation flow
   - Marketing campaign creation

6. **Expand E2E tests:**
   - Complete launch preparation workflow
   - Multi-page navigation
   - Form submissions

### Medium-term (Priority 3)
7. **Achieve 35% coverage baseline:**
   - Test remaining decomposed components
   - Cover critical business logic
   - Test utility functions

8. **Set up CI/CD testing:**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated test runs on PR
   - Coverage reporting

9. **Add visual regression tests:**
   - Playwright visual comparisons
   - Component screenshot testing

---

## Recommendations

### Testing Best Practices
1. **Write tests alongside new features** - Don't defer testing
2. **Test behavior, not implementation** - Focus on what components do, not how
3. **Use descriptive test names** - "should calculate launch readiness percentage"
4. **Follow AAA pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
5. **Keep tests isolated** - No shared state between tests

### Coverage Goals
- **Critical paths:** 80%+ coverage (auth, payments, data mutations)
- **Business logic:** 70%+ coverage (calculations, validations)
- **UI components:** 50%+ coverage (render, interactions, accessibility)
- **Utilities:** 60%+ coverage (pure functions, helpers)

### Performance
- **Unit tests** should run in < 100ms each
- **Integration tests** should run in < 1s each
- **E2E tests** should run in < 30s each
- **Full test suite** should complete in < 5 minutes

### Maintenance
1. **Review failing tests immediately** - Don't let tests stay red
2. **Update tests when requirements change** - Keep tests in sync
3. **Remove obsolete tests** - Clean up test debt
4. **Refactor common test utilities** - DRY principle applies to tests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Tests fail with import errors**
- **Solution:** Ensure path aliases in `vitest.config.ts` match `tsconfig.json`
- **Verify:** `@` alias points to `./src` directory

**Issue: jsdom doesn't support certain browser APIs**
- **Solution:** Mock unavailable APIs in test setup
- **Example:** Mock `window.matchMedia` for responsive tests

**Issue: Tests pass locally but fail in CI**
- **Solution:** Check for environment-specific code
- **Verify:** Tests don't depend on local files or external services

**Issue: Coverage reports are inaccurate**
- **Solution:** Ensure all source files are included
- **Verify:** Coverage exclude patterns in config

**Issue: E2E tests timeout**
- **Solution:** Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
- **Increase:** Default timeout from 30s to 60s

## Appendix

### Test File Naming Conventions
- Unit tests: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `*.integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `*.spec.ts` (Playwright convention)

### Directory Structure Rationale
- `tests/` - Root test directory (separate from source)
- `tests/unit/` - Mirrors `src/` structure for easy navigation
- `tests/integration/` - Organized by feature/workflow
- `tests/e2e/` - Organized by user journey
- `src/test/` - Test utilities and setup (in source for imports)

### Coverage Thresholds Explained
- **35% baseline** - Achievable initial goal
- **50% intermediate** - Good coverage for most projects
- **80% advanced** - Comprehensive coverage for critical systems
