   - No bundle analysis
   - Deployment unverified

3. ❌ **No CI/CD pipeline**
   - No automated testing
   - No quality gates
   - High risk for regressions

**Strengths Identified**:
1. ✅ **Excellent documentation**
   - Comprehensive audit reports
   - Clear architectural planning
   - Detailed refactoring guides

2. ✅ **Proven refactoring pattern**
   - LaunchPreparationHub fully decomposed
   - 1,976 lines → 278 lines
   - Clear example for team to follow

3. ✅ **Strong architectural vision**
   - Roadmap documented
   - Design patterns established
   - Quality standards defined

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Critical Path)

### Week 1: Unblock Development (8-12 hours)
```
Priority 1: Fix Dependencies (Task 1.1)
    ↓
Priority 2: Verify Build (Task 1.2)
    ↓
Priority 3: Security Audit (Task 1.3) + CI/CD (Task 1.4)
```

**Owner Needed**: Senior engineer with npm/build expertise

**Success Criteria**:
- Dependencies install without errors
- Build completes successfully
- CI/CD pipeline running
- Security vulnerabilities documented

### Week 2-6: High Priority Work (80-120 hours)
**Can parallelize after Week 1 complete**

- Component decomposition (4 components)
- Fixture compliance fixes
- Schema validation
- Utilities split

**Owner Needed**: 2-3 engineers can work in parallel

## 📈 Effort Summary

| Priority | Tasks | Hours | % of Total |
|----------|-------|-------|------------|
| 🔴 Critical | 4 | 8-12 | 5-7% |
| 🟠 High | 4 | 80-120 | 47-65% |
| 🟡 Medium | 4 | 30-50 | 18-27% |
| 🟢 Low | 4 | 40+ | 22-25% |
| **TOTAL** | **16** | **158-182+** | **100%** |

**Quick Wins** (Complete in 1 day):
- Fix Dependencies (3-4 hours)
- Fix Fixture Compliance (1-2 hours)
- Setup Linting (2-4 hours)
- **Total**: 6-10 hours for significant improvement

---

## 💡 Key Recommendations

### 1. Start with Critical Tasks (This Week)
**Do not** start feature work until dependencies are fixed. Everything blocks on Task 1.1.

### 2. Follow the Proven Pattern
LaunchPreparationHub decomposition is the blueprint. Use `STEP_3_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN.md` as the reference.

### 3. Assign Task Owners
Use the role-based guidance in `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` to match engineers to appropriate tasks.

### 4. Track Progress Weekly
Update the progress tracking section in `NEEDED_TASKS.md` weekly during standups.

### 5. Celebrate Quick Wins
Completing the 3 quick win tasks (6-10 hours) shows immediate progress and builds momentum.
